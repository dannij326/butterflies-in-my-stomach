My first few coding projects! Newbie in the house!!

I'm brand new to coding (trying to break into tech) and I've finally mustered up enough courage to try my hand at some mini-projects I've found online.
It's not much, but hopefully it showcases my abilities and helps me land my first job!

My mini-projects will be in Python and also COBOL.
